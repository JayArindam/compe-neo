                Welcome to <strong>Compe</strong> — your trusted stop for all things computers. We care about your privacy almost as much as you care about finding the perfect specs. When you visit our site, we may collect basic info like your name, email, and what kind of gadgets catch your eye. Don't worry — it's just so we can make your experience smoother, faster, and more tailored to your needs.

                Your data is safe with us. We don’t sell it, rent it out, or use it for anything shady. Basically, if your data were a laptop, we’d treat it like a high-end gaming rig — protected, optimized, and not for sale. If we ever need to use your data beyond the basics, you’ll be the first to know (and we’ll ask nicely).

                We do use cookies — the digital kind, not the snack (sadly). These help us understand what you like, whether it's powerful processors or sleek designs, so we can show you more of what matters. You can always manage your cookie preferences in your browser settings — no hard feelings.
